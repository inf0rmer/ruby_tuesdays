## Letâ€™s make a dictionary!

### Rules:

- Create a program that has a dictionary of words. The user is asked to
  translate a random word of this dictionary. The program outputs feedback if
  the user is right or wrong. (see dictionary_01.rb)
- Extend the program so that it iterates through the whole dictionary. (see
  dictionary_02.rb)

### Bonus:

- The program gives feedback about the number of correct items. (see
  dictionary_03.rb)
- The user can repeat 3 times in case she is wrong. (see dictionary_04.rb)
- The user can skip to the next question. (see dictionary_05.rb)

### Advanced:

- The user can switch between two modes (see dictionary_06.rb):
  - entering new words
  - reviewing words

### New topics

- Hash: http://devdocs.io/ruby/hash
- Array#sample: http://devdocs.io/ruby/array#method-i-sample
- String interpolation: "Hello #{name}!"
- String#strip: http://devdocs.io/ruby/string#method-i-strip
- Hash#each: http://devdocs.io/ruby/hash#method-i-each
- break statement in while loop
