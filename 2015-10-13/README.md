## Exercise #1

Write a class `Rectangle` and a class `Triangle`. Both classes should inherit from a class that is called `Shape`.  All
shapes have the attribute `color`. In addition, a triangle has a `base` and a `height` whereas a rectangle has
the attributes `length` and `width`. All classes (`Shape`, `Rectangle`, `Triangle`) should have a instance method
`print` printing out information about its attributes, e.g., "Shape of color=green". Rectangles and triangle compute
their `area` differently. Implement a method `area` for both which computes it.
